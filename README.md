Campus Guidebook
===

The Campus Guidebook app aims at helping current students and people  
interested in Cascadia find their way to events and destinations.


# Customers
* New Cascadia students
* Current Cascadia students
* Heads of clubs and programs
## Personas
* As new students of Cascadia, you may find it hard to navigate the  
  Campus grounds and buildings. Our application will help you find your way along  
  with helping you get connected with the many clubs offered at Cascadia.

* Like new students, current students can find it hard to know where  
  events take place. Because of the variety of clubs offered at Cascadia, it can be  
  confusing finding the meetings. Our application will tell you the date, time, and  
  location on the map where the event will take place.

* You are the leader of the sustainability club. You want to get the word out about an upcoming event.  The guidebook application will allow you to add an event and get the word out.

## Pain points and user needs
* Lack of ability to find events is a problem
* Events on the cascadia webpage are hard to find
* Event locations can be hard to find
* Sustainability features of the campus are not well known
